# E-Commerce Site Backend

## Description

This app is a back-end for a hypothecital ecommerce site built using sequelize, mysql2, dotenv, and express.

## Installation

This app uses the sequelize, mysql2, dotenv, and express packages. Run npm install from the command line to install the required dependancies. You will also need to add you MySQL username and password into a .env file. There is an example .env file to use located at envexample.txt in the root directory of this project.

## Usage

Run npm start from the command line to start the server once the dependancies are installed. This application has no front end, so you will need to use a tool like Insomnia to test the routes in this application. Examples of the routes can be found in the demonstration video below, and the routes are all located in routes/api/ for reference.
